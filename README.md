# Blog-Post-Writer
This project implements a multi-agent AI system that generates a blog post by first researching a given topic and then writing a structured article. The system leverages the CrewAI framework for managing the agents and uses Serper.dev for web research. The AI agents are powered by Gemini 1.5 Flash.

## Features
- Research Agent: Uses Serper.dev to gather relevant information from the web.
- Writing Agent: Uses Gemini 1.5 Flash to generate a blog post consisting of 4 paragraphs based on the research.
- CrewAI Framework: Manages the interaction between both agents.
